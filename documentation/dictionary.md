In the lobby, all existing rundowns are listed.

## Rundown View

{% hint style="warning" %}
Documentation for this section is yet to be written.
{% endhint %}

The Rundown View is the main view that the producer is working in.

Things that should be covered: 

* What are all the labels, countdowns, colors, signs etc?

#### Rundown dividers

When using a workflow and blueprints that combine multiple NRCS Rundowns into a single Sofie Rundown \(such as when using the "Ready To Air" functionality in AP ENPS\), information about these individual NRCS Rundowns will be inserted into the Rundown View at the point where each of these incoming Rundowns start.

For reference, these headers show the Name, Planned Start and Planned Duration of the individual NRCS Rundown.

### Shelf

The shelf contains lists of AdLibs that can be played out.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Shelf can be opened by clicking the handle at the bottom of the screen, or by pressing the TAB key
{% endhint %}

### Side panel

#### Notification center

{% endhint %}

#### Switchboard

![Switchboard](../.gitbook/assets/switchboard.png)

The Switchboard allows the producer to turn automation _On_ and _Off_ for sets of devices, as well as re-route automation control between devices - both with an active rundown and when no rundown is active in a [Studio](features-and-configuration/concepts-and-architecture.md#system-organization-studio-and-show-style).

The Switchboard panel can be accessed from the Rundown View's right-hand Toolbar, by clicking on the Switchboard button, next to the Support panel button.

{% hint style="info" %}
Technically, the switchboard activates and deactivates Route Sets. The Route Sets are grouped by Exclusivity Group. If an Exclusivity Group contains exactly two elements with the `ACTIVATE_ONLY` mode, the Route Sets will be displayed on either side of the switch. Otherwise, they will be displayed separately in a list next to an _Off_ position. See also [Settings ‚óè Route sets](features-and-configuration/settings-view.md#route-sets).
{% endhint %}

### Playing things

![](../.gitbook/assets/takenext%20%281%29.png)

#### Take Point

The Take point is currently playing [Part](dictionary.md#part) in the rundown, indicated by the "On Air" line in the GUI.  
What's played on air is calculated from the timeline objects in the Pieces in the currently playing part.

The Pieces inside of a Part determines what's going to happen, the could be indicating things like VT:s, cut to cameras, graphics, or what script the host is going to read.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can TAKE the next [Part](dictionary.md#part) by pressing F12 or the Numpad Enter key.
{% endhint %}

#### Next Point

The Next point is the next queued Part in the rundown. When the user clicks _Take_, the Next Part becomes the currently playing part, and the Next point is also moved.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the Next point by right-clicking in the GUI, or by pressing \(Shift +\) F9 & F10.
{% endhint %}

#### Lookahead

Elements in the [Next point ](dictionary.md#next-point)\(or beyond\) might be pre-loaded or "put on preview", depending on the blueprints and play-out devices used. This feature is called "Lookahead".

## Additional views

Sofie features a few separate views, such as the prompter, [read about them here](features-and-configuration/sofie-pages.md).
